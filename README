```
# install
npm install
# deploy 
npx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/deployDao.js
# please update the contract address after edit contract and re-deploy
# test
npx hardhat test --network hardhat # on local hardhat net, no need to deploy
npx hardhat test # on remote sepolia test net

## Attack
npx hardhat run scripts/attack.js --network attack
```

The following is how to run the updated attack test script.
Note that the attack is written in the form of a hardhat test and only tested under local node, so you need to adapt it to the test net version. A few changes are made over the `Attack.sol` and `Dao.sol`.
```
npx hardhat test test/attack.local.test.js --network hardhat
```
